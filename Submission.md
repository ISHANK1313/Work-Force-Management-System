## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Bug 1: Task Re-assignment Creates Duplicates

**Before:**  
Two tasks with the same type could be assigned to different staff for the same reference ID.

**Fix:**  
When reassigning, old tasks are cancelled and only one task remains active.

**Testing:**

View all tasks:

```
GET /task-mgmt
```

Reassign task:

```
POST /task-mgmt/assign-by-ref
```

Body:
```json
{
  "reference_id": 201,
  "reference_type": "ENTITY",
  "assignee_id": 4
}
```

Verify only one task is ASSIGNED (to assignee 4), others are CANCELLED:

```
GET /task-mgmt
```

### Bug 2: Cancelled Tasks Clutter the View

**Before:**  
Cancelled tasks appeared in date-filtered task views.

**Fix:**  
Cancelled tasks are now excluded from results.

**Testing:**

```
POST /task-mgmt/fetch-by-date/v2
```

Body:
```json
{
  "start_date": 1640995200000,
  "end_date": 1672531200000,
  "assignee_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

Verify CANCELLED tasks no longer appear.

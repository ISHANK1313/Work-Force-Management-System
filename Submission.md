üêõ Bug Fixes
Bug 1: Task Re-assignment Creates Duplicates
Before:
Two tasks with the same type could be assigned to different staff for the same reference ID.

Fix:
When reassigning, the system cancels old tasks and keeps only one active task.

Testing:

http
Copy
Edit
# View all tasks
GET /task-mgmt

# Reassign task
POST /task-mgmt/assign-by-ref
{
  "reference_id": 201,
  "reference_type": "ENTITY",
  "assignee_id": 4
}

# Verify only one task is ASSIGNED, others are CANCELLED
GET /task-mgmt
Bug 2: Cancelled Tasks Clutter the View
Before:
Cancelled tasks appeared in the date-filtered task view.

Fix:
Cancelled tasks are now excluded from the results.

Testing:

http
Copy
Edit
# Fetch tasks in a date range
POST /task-mgmt/fetch-by-date/v2
{
  "start_date": 1640995200000,
  "end_date": 1672531200000,
  "assignee_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}

# Verify CANCELLED tasks no longer appear
‚ú® New Features
